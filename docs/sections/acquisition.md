# Create a training set of images

```{margin}
Estimated time for this step: 10-15 minutes.
```

You should start by collecting a set of representative images of the objects you'd like to detect. For a first try, we recommend that you take **five** images for training and **two** for validation. You should vary the "scene" by placing different objects in the field of view for each image. You can keep the magnification fixed between the images.

```{tip}
Having 5 to 10 objects of each type in each image should be good enough (keep in mind that you'll have to manually annotate all of them later!).
```

Organize your images into a dedicated folder named `dataset` on your computer. Within this folder, create a subfolder called `images`, and further divide it into `train` for training images and `val` for validation images. You can save your training images under `train` and your validation images under `val`. The images should be in either `png`, `jpeg`, or `tif` format (they should be RGB colored images).

Hereâ€™s an example of how your dataset folder structure should look:

```
dataset
|---- images
        |---- train
             |---- image_01.png
             |---- image_02.png
             |---- ...
             |---- image_05.png
        |---- val
             |---- image_01.png
             |---- image_02.png
```

```{admonition} Tips for acquiring a good training set

- It is true that having more images in your training set generally improves performance. However, when fine-tuning a pretrained model (as we will do), we generally need much fewer images than when training a model from scratch.

- You should ensure that your training set is representative of the variety of lighting, focus, magnification, background, as well as objects and object placements that the model is likely to encounter during operation.
